<h1> Re-Invention </h1>
<p>This is a repository where I just decided to re-train myself, as well as train others how to <b><strike>code</strike></b>, <b>Develop</b>, and <b>Design</b> Systems. Throughout this journey, I plan to learn and teach the fundamentals of programming using <b>C, C++, C#, Java, JS, PHP, Rust</b></p>
<p>Any member of this program will devote themselves to coding every single day until the code stack is complete, <b>Every single Day</b></p>
